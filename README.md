- 👋 Hi, I'm Samuel Liu.
- 🏫 I am a recent undergraduate student from an unknown university.
- 💻 The major code is 080906, and yes, the Digital Media Technology program under the Computer Science category.
- 😒 *Don't ask me what this major is, in a nutshell, a combination of computer technology and design.*
- 🎯  My current goal is a job search. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to contribute to a dynamic team.
- 💪 I am well aware that I am a blank sheet of paper and I hope to use this platform to document my growth.
- 🧐 What kind of personality am I? I think telling you my mbti personality type will give you a basic impression. INFJ, seems like a good one?
